# Loanex

The assessment proposal which we'll develop together is provide a person with the loan types suitable for her, given some variables:

We must provide the following loan types:

- Personal Loan. Interest Rate: 4%
- Collateralized Loan. Interest Rate: 3%
- Payroll Loan. Interest Rate: 2%

Listed below are the business rules for conceding a loan based on the person's profile:

|                        | Personal Loan | Collateralized Loan | Payroll |
| ---------------------- | ------------- | :-----------------: | ------- |
| Income <= 3000         | Yes           |      Yes\*\*\*      | No      |
| Income > 3000 & < 5000 | Yes           |       Yes\*\*       | No      |
| Income => 5000         | Yes           |        Yes\*        | Yes     |

- \* Clients under 30 y.o.
- \*\* Clients residing in SP (São Paulo state code in Brazil)
- \*\*\* Clients under 30 y.o. residing in SP

### App usage:

The application must receive the following data as input:

##### input

```json
{
  "customer": {
    "name": "Erikaya",
    "cpf": "123.456.789-10",
    "age": 29,
    "location": "SP",
    "income": 3000
  }
}
```

_For the sake of simplicity, consider we'll always receive the correct data (types and formats)_

And must respond the following data:

##### output

```json
{
  "customer": "Erikaya",
  "loans": [
    {
      "type": "personal",
      "taxes": 1
    }
  ]
}
```
